        <p>"feels like the whole world is asking me to download my brain. Asking everyone. Pass on your wisdom to your son. Tweet your thought. Make art. Express yourself.  Leave something behind before you depart this earth. Your worth depends on what you give to the world and the humans in it. I guess it's just the way it works. You are nothing if you are just trapped in your head. The internal is nothing until it trespasses the .. into the external. Beautiful thoughts don't count for shit until it is manipulated into something tangible for someone else to feel or discover. Beauty in itself is nothing. So here I succumb to you. You are my master I am your slave. I do everything for you. I will give you all that I have the little that I have. Maybe it will be worthwhile to you. Probably not. Maybe I will finally feel self-worth from the worth you give me. I don't care. </p>
        <p>Take me.

        Welcome to my brain.
